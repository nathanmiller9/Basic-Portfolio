                    <p>I'm originally from a Washington, DC suburb, Vienna, Virginia. I grew up playing and enjoying a lot of sports. Baseball was and still is my favorite. But I also took up music pretty early on. After stints with the piano, cello, oboe, and trumpet, I discovered that I wasn't a terrible singer when I got to college. This led to a 20 year career in independent music where I was fortunate enough to have made a lot of recordings and given many performances. Even so, I've always kept a day job to pay the bills, gaining great experience in multiple industries.
                        <p>In 2009, I moved to Los Angeles, California, for a new adventure. I love Washington, DC, but I have grown to love the west coast just as much. I met my wife here and have been married since June, 2016. I also enjoy writing new music and singing from time to time.
                            <p>This January, I embarked on my newest adventure.. studying coding at UCLA Extension. I am thoroughly enjoying learning this new skill and looking forward to embarking on this new career!
