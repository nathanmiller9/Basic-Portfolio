                    		I'm originally from Vienna, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, DC. I grew up playing and enjoying a lot of sports. Baseball was and still is my favorite. But I also took on music at a pretty early age. After stints with the piano, cello, oboe, and trumpet, when I got to college I discovered that I wasn't a terrible singer. This led to a lengthy career in independent music where I was fortunate enough to have made a lot of recordings and given many performances. Even so, I've always kept a day job to pay the bills, gaining great experience in multiple industries.
                        		<p>In 2009, I moved to Los Angeles, California, for a new adventure. I love Washington, DC, but I have grown to love the west coast just as much. I met my wife here and have been married since June, 2016. I also enjoy writing new music and singing from time to time.
                            		<p>This January, I embarked on my newest adventure.. studying coding at UCLA Extension. I am thoroughly enjoying learning this new skill and looking forward to embarking on this new career!
